# management-of-own-home
This project initiated on 29.08.2024 aims to facilitate the need of the owner of a house to have control over everything related to it:

- lands (gardens/orchards, surface, content)

-cars (in this section, you will find the car's information: what is related to its book/certificate
her tul, revisions and others)

-weekly/monthly expenses (the user can have a record of expenses by category, e.g.: animal feed, drinks, various foods, etc.)

-optional: events to which the owner, family members must participate (if they have Facebook, be redirected to them through a link), task list, weather section, dashboard

- we will add others along the way...
